Unfortunately trying to develop on a Pinephone Pro is like crippling yourself on purpose.

This is probably obvious but if you time normal development processes like `npm install` it will take several minutes vs. a couple of seconds.

It unfortunately is not really practical, depends what you're working on.

Apple Magic keyboard bluetooth works, same for volume F11/F12

Takes about 10 minutes for `npx create-react-app app-name` to run

40 some seconds to install Dexie

forgot how to use `workbox-cli`

`npx workbox-cli` maybe

missing this `workbox-config.js` file, referenced from calorie counter app
